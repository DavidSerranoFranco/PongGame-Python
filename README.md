# 🏓 **Pong Game with AI - Python & Pygame**

---

## 📜 **Project Description**
This is a classic **Pong game** implemented in Python using the **Pygame** library. The project includes two game modes:

🎮 **Two-Player Mode:** Two players compete against each other, each controlling a paddle.

🤖 **Single-Player Mode:** One player competes against an **AI** that controls the second paddle.

The game features an **interactive menu** to select the game mode and the number of points required to win. It also includes **sound effects, a scoring system, and an intuitive graphical interface**.

---

## ✨ **Main Features**
✔️ **Interactive Menu:** Choose between playing against AI or two-player mode.

✔️ **Point Selection:** Play up to **5 or 10 points**.

✔️ **Artificial Intelligence:** The AI efficiently follows the ball, providing a realistic challenge.

✔️ **Sound Effects:** Custom sounds for hits, bounces, and scores.

✔️ **Graphical Interface:** Clean, responsive design with custom colors and centered text.

✔️ **Restart & Exit Options:** Restart the game, return to the main menu, or exit anytime.
